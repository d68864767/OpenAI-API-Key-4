# Data Retention Policies

Data retention policies are crucial for managing the lifecycle of the data stored in our API. These policies define how long the data is kept, when it should be deleted, and when it should be archived. 

## Importance of Data Retention Policies

Data retention policies are important for several reasons:

- **Legal Compliance**: Certain types of data are required by law to be kept for a certain period of time.
- **Data Management**: Retention policies help manage the storage space efficiently.
- **Privacy**: Proper data retention policies can help protect user privacy by ensuring data is not kept longer than necessary.

## Key Components of Data Retention Policies

A comprehensive data retention policy should include the following components:

- **Retention Period**: The length of time data is kept before it is deleted or archived.
- **Data Classification**: Different types of data may need to be retained for different periods of time.
- **Data Deletion**: The process for securely deleting data after the retention period.
- **Data Archiving**: The process for storing data that needs to be kept longer than the retention period.

## Implementing Data Retention Policies

Here is a basic example of how to implement data retention policies in our API:

```python
class DataRetentionPolicy:
    def __init__(self, retention_period, data_classification, data_deletion, data_archiving):
        self.retention_period = retention_period
        self.data_classification = data_classification
        self.data_deletion = data_deletion
        self.data_archiving = data_archiving

    def apply_policy(self, data):
        if self.data_classification(data) == 'short_term':
            self.data_deletion(data, self.retention_period)
        else:
            self.data_archiving(data, self.retention_period)
```

This is a simplified example and actual implementation may vary based on specific requirements and the nature of the data.

## Conclusion

Data retention policies are an essential part of data management in APIs. They help ensure legal compliance, efficient use of storage, and protection of user privacy.
