# HTML Response Type

The OpenAI API can return responses in HTML format. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

## Overview

HTML is a markup language that is used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the backbone of any website and is an essential skill for any web professional. It is also very useful for SEO specialists, as search engines read HTML to understand and rank webpages.

## Working with HTML in OpenAI API

When you make a request to the OpenAI API, you can specify the response format as HTML. Here is an example of how to do this:

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'

response = openai.Completion.create(
  engine="davinci-codex",
  prompt="Translate the following English text to French: '{}'",
  max_tokens=60,
  format="html"
)

print(response.choices[0].text.strip())
```

In this example, the `format` parameter is set to "html". The response from the API will be a HTML string.

## Parsing HTML Response

Once you receive a HTML response, you can parse it and extract the information you need. Here is an example of how to parse a HTML response:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Assume `response` is the HTML response received from the OpenAI API
soup = BeautifulSoup(response, 'html.parser')

# Accessing data in the parsed response
text = soup.get_text().strip()
print(text)
```

In this example, the BeautifulSoup library is used to parse the HTML response. The parsed response is a BeautifulSoup object and you can access its elements using the BeautifulSoup's methods.

## Conclusion

HTML is a fundamental and widely used data format. The ability to receive responses from the OpenAI API in HTML format allows for easy integration with many different programming languages and systems, especially those related to web development.
