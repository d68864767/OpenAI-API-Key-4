## Setup

To use the OpenAI API across different platforms, you need to set up the OpenAI client library in each platform. The setup process varies depending on the platform. Please refer to the respective language-specific guides for detailed instructions:

- [Python](../language_guides/python.md)
- [JavaScript](../language_guides/javascript.md)
- [Ruby](../language_guides/ruby.md)
- [PHP](../language_guides/php.md)
- [Java](../language_guides/java.md)
- [C#](../language_guides/csharp.md)
- [Node.js](../language_guides/nodejs.md)
- [Go](../language_guides/go.md)
- [Swift](../language_guides/swift.md)

## Making API Calls

Once the setup is complete, you can start making API calls. The process of making API calls is similar across all platforms. You need to create a request with the appropriate parameters and send it to the OpenAI API. The specific syntax for making API calls may vary depending on the platform. Please refer to the respective language-specific guides for detailed instructions.

## Handling Responses

The OpenAI API responds with a JSON object. The structure of the response is the same across all platforms. However, the method of extracting information from the response may vary depending on the platform. Please refer to the respective language-specific guides for detailed instructions.

## Error Handling

When an error occurs during an API call, the OpenAI API responds with an error message. The method of handling these errors may vary depending on the platform. Please refer to the respective language-specific guides for detailed instructions.
