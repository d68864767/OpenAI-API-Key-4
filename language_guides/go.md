4. [Error Handling](#error-handling)

## Setup

To use the OpenAI API with Go, you need to install the OpenAI Go client library. You can install it using go get:

```bash
go get github.com/openai/openai-go
```

Then, import the library in your Go script:

```go
import "github.com/openai/openai-go"
```

Set your API key:

```go
openai.ApiKey = "your-api-key"
```

## Making API Calls

Here's an example of how to make an API call:

```go
params := &openai.CompletionCreateParams{
  Engine:   "text-davinci-002",
  Prompt:   "Translate the following English text to French: '{}'",
  MaxTokens: 60,
}
response, _, err := openai.Completion.Create(params)
```

## Handling Responses

The API response is a struct. Here's how to extract information from the response:

```go
translated_text := response.Choices[0].Text
fmt.Println(translated_text)
```

## Error Handling

If an error occurs during the API call, the error will be returned. Here's how to handle errors:

```go
if err != nil {
  fmt.Println("Error:", err)
}
```

Remember to always handle errors appropriately in your real code.

## Conclusion

This guide should have given you a basic understanding of how to use the OpenAI API with Go. For more detailed information, refer to the [official OpenAI API documentation](https://github.com/openai/openai-go).
