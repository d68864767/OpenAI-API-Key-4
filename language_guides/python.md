4. [Error Handling](#error-handling)

## Setup

To use the OpenAI API with Python, you need to install the OpenAI Python client library. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install openai
```

Then, import the library in your Python script:

```python
import openai
```

Set your API key:

```python
openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'
```

## Making API Calls

Here's an example of how to make an API call:

```python
response = openai.Completion.create(
  engine="text-davinci-002",
  prompt="Translate the following English text to French: '{}'",
  max_tokens=60
)
```

## Handling Responses

The API response is a JSON object. Here's how to extract information from the response:

```python
translated_text = response['choices'][0]['text']
print(translated_text)
```

## Error Handling

If the API call fails, an exception will be raised. Here's how to handle exceptions:

```python
try:
    response = openai.Completion.create(
      engine="text-davinci-002",
      prompt="Translate the following English text to French: '{}'",
      max_tokens=60
    )
except openai.Error as e:
    print(e)
```
